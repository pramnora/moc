## Introduction

I'm creating this page in order to store *links* to courses which I already went and signed up for...;     
otherwise, what tends to happen is -especially, if I hadn't visited that site in absolute ages; then-       
I tend to completely forget...? If I went and *paid* good money to join that course/or, those courses...;   
then, forgetting where the link was...; also amounts to me **wasting** all of the money I just went and spent!

**NOTE**: The GitHub/Netlify link to this page is:
